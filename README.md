## üìå Project Description  

In groups (1 or 2 people), you will select a trailer of a video game or movie that is about to be released.
The goal is to use an audio editing software, in this case Audacity, to edit the trailer‚Äôs sound without modifying the video. The objective is to change the meaning of the trailer. For example, if it is a horror movie trailer, edit it so it looks like a comedy.

To achieve this, you must use multiple tools that modify audio properties, such as changing frequency, timing, volume, order, or by removing and adding sounds.

Keep in mind that Audacity only supports audio files, so the audio must first be extracted from the video, edited, and then replaced in the original video. For this step, external software is required. You may use web applications that simplify this task, or alternatively, the free software DaVinci Resolve, which is a professional video editing tool.  

The work consists of two main parts:  
1. **Audio Edition with Audacity**  
2. **Add the audio to the Video**
